1. What is a data type? Why do we have data types?
- regular data types include CHAR and VARCHAR.
-unicode data types include NCHAR and NVARCHAR. This requires 2 bytes per character.
2. What is a collation? Name four elements of a collation.
- a property of character data that encapsulates several aspects
-four elements:
-language support,
-sort order,
-case sensitivity
-accent sensitivity

3. How would you strip whitespace from a string? For example, suppose you had “ Dave ” but
wanted only “Dave”.
- -You can use the RTRIM and LTRIM function to remove leading and/or trailing spaces. You can delimit identifiers by using double quotes or closed brackets. ; Example:  SELECT RTRIM(LTRIM ‘       Dave          ‘  ));

4. Suppose you wanted to make a list of every college and university that was called an Institute from the college table. Write the query.
- select Institute from college, university;

5. How would you find the number of the index of the first space in a string? For example, the index of the first space in “Barack Hussein Obama” would be 7.
-select CHARINDEX (' ','Barack Hussein Obama');

6. How would you select just the first name in a list of the presidents. Each record looks like the: ”George Washington”, ”John Adams”, ”Thomas Jefferson”. First names can be an arbitrary length, from “Cal” to “Benjamin.” (e.g., Cal College, Benjamin Harrison)
- select presidents where first , (name,charindex('',name)) from presidents

7. What is the order of precedence for the logical operators?
- 1. () parenthesis
- 2. * (multiplications), / (division), % (modulo)
- 3. + (positive), -negative, +(additions),+ (concatenation), - (subtraction)
- 4. =, <, <, >, =, <>, !=, !>, !< (Comparison operators)
- 5. not
- 6. and
- 7. between, in, like, or
- 8. = (assignment)

8. What is the order of precedence for the math operators?
- 1. () parenthesis
- 2. * (multiplications)
- 3. / (Division )
- 4. + additions
- 5. subtraction

9. What is the difference between a simple and a searched CASE expression?;
-The simple form is used to compare one value or scalar expression with a list of possible values and return a value for the first match.
-if nothing is found it returns ELSE NULL
-the searched case evaluates multiple Boolean expressions and executes the sequence of statements associated with the first condition that evaluates to true.

10. How would you turn a list of names like this: “LASTNAME, FIRSTNAME”, to a list like this: “FIRSTNAME LASTNAME”?
-SELECT ('1-firstname, 2-lastname()

11. How would you turn a list of names like this: “FIRSTNAME LASTNAME”, to a list like this: “LASTNAME, FIRSTNAME”?
